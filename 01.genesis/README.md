### Installation :hammer:

 Now that you have the main dependencies installed locally, you can download the repository and run the desired project.

 1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mbuguadouglas/web-sandbox.git
    ```
 2. Navigate to the project folder
    ```sh
    cd web-sandbox
    ```
 3. Install the needed requirements located in the `requirements.txt` file
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 4. Run the desired project. This will either be using flask or django, hence is better outlined in the individual project's `README.md`
