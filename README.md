 <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
 ## About The Project :notebook:

 The repository is a fun adventure that I decided to pursue so as to enable me to better grasp the concepts needed to actuate web development using flask and django. Being a hands-on-learner I needed to break the cycle of mindlessly following tutorials and memorizing concepts. Opting to take a project based approach to tackle the problem, I came up with the solution.

 The projects are mostly random and do not follow any particular order only that I try to build and improve on what I learn from the previous project.

 <!-- GETTING STARTED -->
 ## Getting Started :feet:

 To get the projects running, you will need to navigate to the individual project's folder `README.md` and follow the instructions given. However, a more generalized simple step procedure is given below.

 ### Prerequisites :recycle:

 The projects will either need an installation of flask or django. You can confirm this by inputing the following command onto your terminal, and inside the virtual environment, check whether you have an installed version:

 * for Flask
   ```sh
   $ flask --version
   #Python 3.10.14
   #Flask 3.0.3
   #Werkzeug 3.0.2
   ```

 * for Django
   ```sh
   $ python
   >>> import django
   >>> django.get_version()
   ...
   #'5.0.4'
   ```

   > Remember that its is always a good practice develop in a virtual environment to prevent possible breakage with future updates.

 ### Installation :hammer:

 Now that you have the main dependencies installed locally, you can download the repository and run the desired project.

 1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
    ```
 2. Navigate to the project folder
    ```sh
    cd Project-name
    ```
 3. Install the needed requirements located in the `requirements.txt` file
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 4. Run the desired project. This will either be using flask or django, hence is better outlined in the individual project's `README.md`
