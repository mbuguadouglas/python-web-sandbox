 This repository will serve as a playground for experimenting with web based technologies. I took a project based approach to understand various popular languages and frameworks.

 <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
 ## About The Project :notebook:

 The repository is a fun adventure that I decided to pursue so as to enable me to better grasp the concepts needed to actuate web development using popular web-development frameworks and technologies. Being a hands-on-learner I needed to break the cycle of mindlessly following tutorials and memorizing concepts. Opting to take a project based approach to tackle the problem, I came up with the solution.

 The projects are mostly random and do not follow any particular order only that I try to build and improve on what I learn from the previous project.
